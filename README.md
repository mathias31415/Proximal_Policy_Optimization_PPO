This Repository is used for development of the project tasks and deployment of our results.
By Robin wolf and Mathias Fuhrer (RKIM)

First task was to modify a given PPO algotithm for discrete action spaces to handle continuous action spaces.
Second task was to test and compare the discrete PPO, continuous PPO an Stable Baselines implementations.
--> Results are written down in the MountainCar Notebook

Second task was to test our implementation for continouos actions on the hopper enviroment and compare it to Stable Baselines.
--> Results are written down in the Hopper Notebook.

Additional hints:
- beyond the facts mentioned/ explained in the notebooks, detailed comments on changed sections are applied in imported .py files
- to reduce transfered data, only a few of our (more or less succesfull) trained agents are provided in this repository (only 5 to 10 representative agents instead of approx. 60 to 70 trained approaches)
